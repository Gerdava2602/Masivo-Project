# Masivo Capital Project

2. We used a **PostgreSQL** database in **AWS** to store data and create all the required querys and transactions.
3. We made a model to predict demand in each point of the city using *clustering with geospatial data*, *machine learning algorithms* and *deep learning*.
4. We designed and created a web application to display reports, predictions, clustering and KPIs, using **Django Plotly**
